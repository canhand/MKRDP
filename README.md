This Liberary (MKRDP) is used to create Layout in XML file.
With the help of this file developer can create layout for all device.
The values mkrdp_.. are work as a value in a percent based on device width.
      Such as if we draw a line width of mkrdp_80 in SW160dp device then the line is draw from 0-half_of_device_width(PORT), if we draw same line with width mkrdp_80 in any other device then it also drwa from 0-half_of_device_width.
which means the mkrdp_.. is work as a % value correspond to the device width.
